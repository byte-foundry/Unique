	"FAQ.question10Answer": "Web hosting, or simply hosting, is necessary in order to get something live on the Internet. If you build a website that serves a custom font, you will need to host it somewhere. That way your visitors can see it displayed when they will come to your website.

The possibilities are virtually endless, especially if you use the “More customization” option to fine-tune your font.",

	"FAQ.question8Title": "What is a logotype?",
	"FAQ.question9Answer": "- Make sure your logotype itself is recognizable and does not rely on a color alone. Also, keep in mind what the logotype might look like on a dark background!\n        - Make sure that text and fine lines are still legible when the logotype is scaled down to use it for various sizes\n        - We love colors, but they can be distracting.
